                    <h2>Make your content shine by getting out of the way</h2>
                    <p>When was the last time you looked at a website’s menu and thought “gosh, that is just so pretty.” Unless you’re a designer, chances are it’s never. People don’t visit your website to admire the UI. They go there for the content. They
                        go there to get shit done.</p>

                    <p class="quotes">“Good design is as little design as possible.”</p>

                    <p>Fixed headers are fairly common nowadays with big name brands like Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, and others using this pattern. It’s easy to carelessly copy them without any thought to improving on the pattern, but perhaps we
                        should rethink that.
                    </p>
                    <h4> This is also hading </h4>
                    <p>More and more people are using mobile phones where screen real estate is a commodity. Even on desktops and tablets applications that get out of the way and let users focus on content feel better. There’s more room to breathe; your
                        eyes don’t feel like squinting.
                    </p>
                    <p>How can we improve on the fixed header pattern? Here’s a proposal: hide the header as the user scrolls down, and show it again when the user scrolls up. This is not revolutionary. Other apps and websites are already doing this, and
                        it’s pretty sweet. Here’s how you do it.
